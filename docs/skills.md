# Skills

This document lists all skills known in the Blood Bowl 2020 Ruleset and whether they are implemented
in Jervis. If a skill was introduced after the BB2020 base rules, a reference to its source is provided.

Skills marked with * are mandatory.

As a general rule, skills are implemented faithfully, i.e., they should follow the rules as written.
This also includes choosing whether to use them or not. The rules module will generally always ask for 
usage, but this might be responded to automatically by higher layers before being shown as a dialog to 
players. 

Skills should only be marked as completed here if they are implemented and have a test class in
`modules/game-model/src/commonTest/kotlin/dk/ilios/jervis/skills`
