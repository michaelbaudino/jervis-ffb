/**
 * Representation of the "Leader (Passive)" skill. See page 130 in the BB2025
 * rulebook.
 *
 * The skill itself has no effect by itself. It is just a marker used by the
 * rules.
 *
 * Developer's Commentary:
 * The rules concerning the life-cycle of the Leader re-roll are a bit
 * complicated. See the full discussion in
 * [BB2025 Skills](../website/bb2025/bb2025-skills.md).
 *
 * But Jervis uses the following logic for Leader:
 *
 * 1. During the first Start of Drive sequence in both halfs, we add a Leader
 *    reroll if the Leader is placed on the Pitch.
 *
 *    If the Leader is not placed on the Pitch here, the re-roll is not
 *    added in a later Drive in the same half.
 *
 * 2. During the half. If the Leader leaves the Pitch, the re-roll is
 *    disabled immediately if no other Leaders are present.  If all Leaders are
 *    marked as "Removed from Play", the re-roll is completely removed.
 *
 * 3. If the Leader leaves the Pitch and is later returned, e.g., when setting
 *    up a new Drive, the re-roll is re-enabled (if not already used).
 *
 * 4. A Leader re-roll added in the last half, carry over into Extra Time, but
 *    will start disabled if the Leader isn't placed in the first Drive. It can
 *    be re-enabled if the Leader is returned to the Pitch during Extra Time.
