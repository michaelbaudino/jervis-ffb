/**
 * Procedure for handling a player moving "one step". "One step" is categorized as
 * any of the following moves:
 *
 *  - Normal move
 *  - Standing Up,
 *  - Rush
 *  - Jump
 *  - Leap
 *
 *  Turnovers are handled in the parent procedures that called this one.
 *
 *  --------------
 *  Developer's Notes:
 *
 *  To make it easier to handle the different kinds of movement, it is required
 *  to select the type before choosing the target.
 *
 *  This means a normal move is represented as
 *  [MoveType.STANDARD, Square(x,y), MoveType.STANDARD, Square(x1, y1), ...]
 *
 * The other option would have been to calculate all possible targets and
 * then enhance the field location with that type data. This was considered but
 * rejected because it would lead to a lot of calculations on each move,
 * especially if you also want to support the UI moving multiple steps in one go.
 *
 * Mixing the two would fundamentally mean that UI logic bleeds into the rule
 * layer, which is also not desirable.
 *
 * Even though the move logic looks a little more ugly due to this, we can
 * hide it in the UI layer using automated actions.
 *
 * The FUMBBL Client also has a different UI for e.g., rushing (yellow square)
 * vs. Jump (context menu action).
 *
 * Jumping are handled in [JumpStep]
 * Standing up are handled in [StandingUpStep]
