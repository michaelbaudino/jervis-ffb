/**
 * Procedure for handling the Kick-Off Event: "HighKick" as described on page 41
 * of the rulebook.
 *
 *  Developer's Commentary:
 *  Following the strict ordering of the rules, the Kick-Off Event is resolved
 *  before "What Goes Up, Must Come Down". This means that the touchback rule cannot
 *  yet be applied when High Kick is resolved.
 *
 *  No-where is it stated that the high kick player cannot enter the opponent's field.
 *  So in theory, it would be allowed to move a player into the opponent's field and
 *  then resolve the ball coming down.
 *
 *  This would result in a touchback, and the the ball could be given to the player
 *  that moved into the opponent's half.
