     * Developer's Commentary:
     * We need to have a way to tell the rest of the system who is responsible for
     * creating the [GameAction]. It might technically be more correct to store this
     * inside [Game] or the [GameActionDescriptor], but either of these approaches
     * would make the code quite a bit more convoluted. So for now, we are just
     * treating it as metadata that are part of a node, similar to [Procedure.initialNode]
     *
     * This approach also assumes that any given node only accepts input from
     * one player. Which (for now) seems a reasonable restriction.
