/**
 * Resolve push, including any chain pushes. If the last player is pushed into
 * the crowd, it is resolved here.
 *
 * Pushing players is a complicated process, involving a lot of skills and timings.
 * The logic is implemented in the following way, with Player A = pusher and
 * Player B = pushee.
 *
 * 1. Player A starts blitz or block and must decide to use Juggernaut or not (before the push start).
 *    a. Cannot be used on chain pushes.
 *
 * 2. Player B must decide whether to use Stand Firm. Page 80 in the rulebook.
 *    a. Cannot be used if Player A used Juggernaut.
 *    b. Can be used on chain pushes.
 *
 * 3. Player A must decide whether to use Grab. Page 80 in the rulebook.
 *    a. Cannot be used while blitzing.
 *    b. Cannot be used on chain pushes.
 *    c. Cannot be used if no unoccupied squares exist adjacent to Player B.
 *
 * 4. Player B must decide whether to use Sidestep. Page 75 in the rulebook.
 *.   a. Cannot be used if Player A used Grab.
 *    c. Cannot be used if no unoccupied squares exist adjacent to Player B.
 *
 * 5. Player B must decide whether to use Fend. See page 76 in the rulebook.
 *    a. Cannot be used on a chain push.
 *    b. Cannot be used if Player A has Ball & Chain.
 *    c. Cannot be used if Player A is blitzing and using Juggernaut.
 *
 * I could not find any definitive answer for the next scenarios, i.e., what happens
 * if you end up with a circular chain push. It is theoretically possible to have
 * a chain push go back to the start, but it is unclear what happens in that case.
 *
 * There exist at least three scenarios:
 *
 * 1. With 24 players, it is possible for a Player C to push Player A away from
 *    its starting location, so it no longer is adjacent to Player B's starting
 *    location.
 *
 * 2. With 24 players, it is possible to potentially push a player C into Player
 *    B's starting location.
 *
 * 3. With 28 players, it is possible to create an infinite circle that never ends.
 *    However, this is up to the pushing coach, and they can just choose a different
 *    chain push sequence to break it.
 *
 * To account for these cases, this procedure implements the following logic:
 *
 * - When calculating a chain push, players are considered as having left their
 *   square as soon as the push direction is selected, i.e., their square is
 *   available in case of a circular chain. But the players are not moved into
 *   their target square until the entire chain is resolved.
 *
 * - If Player A is moved away so it is no longer adjacent to Player B's starting
 *   square, they are no longer allowed to follow up. The reason is due to the
 *   following sentence in the rules: "Sometimes, a player must follow-up due to
 *   an in-game effect, a special rule, or a Skill or Trait, whether they want to
 *   or not.", in this case, the in-game effect is a push or chain-push.
 *
 * - Due to the possibility of circular chain pushes, we risk having two players
 *   in the same location no matter if the chain is resolved from the start or
 *   from the end. To make it more natural, we resolve the chain from the
 *   beginning.
 *
 * The choice of resolving from the start has consequences for Treacherous
 * Trapdoor, Scoring, Ball Clone, and being Pushed Into The Crowd.
 *
 * **Treacherous Trapdoor**
 * If a chain-push results in a player being pushed into another square with a
 * player standing on a trapdoor, what happens?
 *
 *   a. The player can fall into the trapdoor before chain-pushing the other
 *      player out. If it falls through, the chain just stops there. The original
 *      player stays on the trapdoor.
 *   b. The check for trapdoor isn't done until after the full chain is resolved.
 *      Potentially leaving a "hole" in the chain.
 *
 * You could probably argue for both interpretations, so in this case, we use
 * option A, as it is easier to implement in [ResolvePush]. However, due to how
 * the logic is set up, you select all steps of the chain without checking for
 * trapdoors, and the trapdoor check is then done when fully resolving the chain.
 *
 * **Scoring **
 * If Ball Clone is in play, and you have a ball on the ground and a ball carried
 * by a player that is pushed into the End Zone, then we are going to check for
 * scoring for the player being pushed into the End Zone first, before checking
 * for Pickup (because that will happen by the end of chain-push).
 *
 * If a touchdown is scored during the push-back, we will still resolve the entire
 * chain (including pushing people into the crowd) before the turn-over is triggered.
 *
 * This means a push is modeled this way:
 * ```
 *   for_each_step_in_chain {
 *      playerA.location = pushed_into_location
 *      field.get(pushed_into_location) = playerA
 *      // At this point in time playerA.location == playerB.location (which is fine)
 *   }
 * ```
 */
