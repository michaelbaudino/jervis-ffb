/**
 * This class is responsible for tracking all the "static" rules related to a game of Blood Bowl, as well
 * as helper methods for often asked questions. Concepts from the rulebook liked "Is a marked player" should
 * generally be found in this class, rather than a specific [com.jervisffb.engine.fsm.Procedure].
 *
 * This class should only contain rules for running a game, not rules for building rosters.
 *
 * When defining pitch sizes, the "board" is assumed to be laid out vertically. I.e., from left to right
 * with the home team always on the left and the away team always on the right. Coordinates start from
 * the upper-left corner with (0,0). If the UI wants to represent things differently, it is responsible
 * for swapping coordinates.
 *
 * Methods in this class have been implemented using the standard BB2025 behavior, so subclasses only need to
 * override them if the behavior differs from that.
 *
 * Developer's Commentary:
 * The idea is that this class should be able to represent all game types, but that hasn't been
 * fully tested yet, e.g., Dungeon Bowl has a very different view of what the pitch looks
 * and behaves, so most likely some aspects need to be redesigned.*
 * It is also a bit unclear how well this class transcends ruleset, i.e., between BB2016 and BB2020
