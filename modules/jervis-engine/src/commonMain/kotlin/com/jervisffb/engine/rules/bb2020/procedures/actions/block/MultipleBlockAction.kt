/**
 * This procedure is responsible for handling Multiple Block as described on page 80 in the rulebook.
 *
 * Designer's Commentary:
 * - When using Grab, the blocked players starting square are treated as being Occupied, regardless of
 *   who is moved first.
 * - Blocked players cannot offer assists to each other.
 * - Stab can be used on both block actions.
 *
 * Developer's Commentary:
 * Multiple Block is a challenge to implement as it breaks the flow of multiple skills and actions.
 * It is also very vaguely worded, and the description doesn't cover a lot of edge cases.
 **
 * It is especially unclear how "performed simultaneously" should be interpreted, but to accommodate Designer's
 * Commentary, we try to resolve the blocks in lock-steps (or as much as possible).
 *
 * It is also unclear how to handle injuries, e.g., should we roll armour/injury dice in lockstep
 * and how does that work with e.g. Stab where the armour/injury roll behave differently.
 * And what about bouncing balls, when do they bounce?
 *
 * Since the rules define none of this, we opt for simplicity and implement lock-step up until the
 * point of resolving a block type, then resolve that block type up to the point of having rolled for armour/injury.
 * And then finally, choose to use apothecary/regeneration or not.
 *
 * For pushes, this means that we fully resolve one push before doing the next.

 * It is unclear what should happen in a circular chain push. In that case, the starting square will be considered
 * empty. This also mirrors the normal push behavior.
 *
 * The starting square will be considered "occupied" for when using Grab on the 2nd player. While this is
 * inconsistent with pushes, it is required as per the rules described in the Designer's Commentary.
 *
 * Also, if we treated the starting square as blocked for pushes, it could result in some scenarios that
 * would look weird on a board. So given that this scenario will probably never surface in a realistic
 * game of Blood Bowl, having the behavior being different seems acceptable.
 *
 * For injuries, we are introducing an "Injury Pool". This means that all injuries that happened to attacker
 * and defenders are placed in that pool and not fully resolved until both actions are "done". Then the blocking
 * coach can see the full effect of all blocks before deciding whether to use the apothecary on
 * all or some of them.
 *
 * For the sake of ease of implementation, crowd-pushes on other players than the ones being blocked
 * are resolved immediately, i.e., they are not placed in the "Injury Pool".
 *
 * All of this means that the logic of operations is as follows:
 *
 * 1. Select both block targets and type of block, i.e., normal block or special action.
 *    a. It is possible to deselect an already selected player again.
 *    b. It is possible to abort the Multiple Block at this point.
 *
 * 2. Roll dice that are not armour/injury for actions.
 *    a. Block: Normal block dice
 *    b. Projectile Vomit: D6 for who is hit.
 *    c. Chainsaw: D6 for who is hit.
 *    d. Breathe Fire: D6 for effect.
 *    c. Stab: No roll here, since it automatically "hit".
 *
 * 3. Select rerolls for both rolls and apply them. This process can happen multiple times here.
 *    a. Blocking player is free to choose the order of using rerolls or not.
 *    b. Pro still only works on one of them.
 *
 * 4. After rerolls are chosen or not. Select the result of both rolls that should be applied.
 *
 * 5. Let the active player decide which player to resolve first.
 *
 * 6. Resolve block results:
 *    a. If two normal blocks, resolve push/chain-pushes individually, including rolling for injuries,
 *       but not rolling for apothecary or bouncing the ball. The player still stays on the field, and
 *       any injuries are placed in an "Injury Pool". Injuries caused by chain pushing other players
 *       into the crowd are resolved fully immediately.
 *    b. If a special action is combined with a block. Resolve each action as chosen by the blocker. Any
 *       injuries are placed in the "injury pool".
 *
 *    c. Any turn-over caused by the first block is postponed until the 2nd block has resolved, i.e., the
 *       blocker does not lose access to skills mid-block.
 *
 * 7. Show the "injury pool" to both coaches and let them decide where to apply the apothecary. Even on all
 *    injuries or only some of them.
 *
 * 8. Finally, if any of the attacker or two defenders had the ball. It will now bounce from their square,
 *    (or the square they left)
